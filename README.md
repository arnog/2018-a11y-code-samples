# 2018-a11y-code-samples
Assembling a collection of best practices examples for common interactions 
(many of which already exist and need to be collated in a central place) 
(e.g., fluid, what sock, W3C Authoring Practices, synchronized text-to-speech highlighting, 
carousels, page settings, datepicker, etc.) 

See our [current Code Repository](https://github.com/benetech/accessible-interactives) 
which is a work in progress for some of the areas we are thinking of and have already started building this out.

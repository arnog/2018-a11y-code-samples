# Drag and Drap with Matching Items without aria-grabbed attributes
Drag and Drop feature is required for so many use cases.
In ARIA 1.1 the drag and drop attributes aria-grabbed and aria-dropeffect were slated to be deprecated. 
So, I have improved the original prototype from opera without using aria-dropeffect and aria-grabbed attribute.
